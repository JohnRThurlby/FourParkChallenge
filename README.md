FourParkChallenge.  App designed for those Disney World enthusiast that try visiting all 4 parks in the same day. Requires a picture of a park Icon, such as Magic Kingdoms castle, 
picture of a receipt showing a park purchase, and a picture taking a ride in the park. If the requirements are met, then a certificate will be sent after photo verification.

Android app using Google maps, geolocation, camera functionlity, email, SMS, connection to EC2 server on AWS for backend PHP/MySQL functionality, and Image upload to same server.
